    <h1>Responsible Gaming</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>Gambling at an online casino should always be aimed at entertainment. However, there is a certain percentage of
      people who lose control over themselves while gambling. Before starting to play, it is important to realize that
      gambling shall never be viewed as a source of income or means of recovery from debts. It is useful to keep track of
      the time and the amount of money spent at an online casino daily.</p>
    <p>If you think that you start spending more money than you can afford, or in case gaming starts interfering with your
      normal daily routines, we strongly advise to consider several measures that can help, such as setting Personal
      Limits on your gaming activities, opting for Self-Exclusion, and seeking help and support from trusted independent
      bodies.</p>
    <h2>Personal Limits</h2>
    <p>To assist you in gambling responsibly we offer the Personal Limits feature. You can set limits on the amount you
      deposit, lose, wager, spend in one game, or on your account activity on the whole. This functionality can be
      accessed within your account in the “Personal Limits” section.</p>
    <p>Limits can be amended at any time. A decrease in the limit will take effect immediately, however an increase may
      only occur after email confirmation and only after the previous limit of the same type expires, in order to avoid
      rash decisions. If you require further information or assistance regarding Personal Limits, please contact our
      support team at support@slotsbet.com.</p>
    <p><b>Deposit Limit.</b>A limit on your deposits for a day, a week, or a month.</p>
    <p><b>Loss Limit.</b>A limit on your losses in the casino for a day, a week, or a month. Please note the loss is based
      on the initial deposit and not winnings attributed to the deposited amount. If for example you deposit 0.0014 BTC,
      put a Loss Limit of 0.00027 BTC and then go on to win 0.027 BTC, you can still lose more than 0.00027 BTC of the
      0.027 BTC balance as it is based on the initial deposit instead of the winnings.</p>
    <p><b>Wager Limit.</b>A limit on the wagered amount for a day, a week, or a month.</p>
    <p><b>Cooling-Off Limit.</b>You can set a Cooling-Off Period for a definite period of time. While the limit is active
      you cannot deposit to the Casino and you will be excluded from all promotional offers, although you may withdraw the
      remaining funds during this period. Cooling-Off period is applied to your account immediately. Upon its expiring
      your account will automatically be re-activated.</p>
    <p><b>Self-Exclusion Limit.</b>You can set a Self-Exclusion Limit for a definite period of time. Upon doing so your
      Player Account will immediately be disabled and you will be excluded from all promotional offers for the set period.
      You will not be able to deposit or withdraw funds when the limit is active. Upon its expiring your account will
      automatically be re-activated.</p>
    <h2>Self-Exclusion by request</h2>
    <p>You may also contact our support team at support@slotsbet.com and inform us about your decision to stop gambling at
      the Website for a certain period of time or forever. We will take all measures to block your access to your account
      and make sure that you receive no promotional materials.</p>

    <h2> Protection of minors</h2>
    <p>The Casino only accepts players who are at least 18 years old and uses all available methods to stop any attempts
      of minors to register and play at our Website. The Casino reserves the right to ask for a proof of identity and in
      case the player has not reached the legal age to play, access to the Website will be denied immediately.</p>
    <p>However, we realize that due to a wide availability and nature of the Internet people under the legal age still
      have a chance to register and play at an online casino. We therefore strongly encourage parents to cooperate in
      protecting their children from free access to gaming websites. There is special software that can help in this
      matter. Please visit the following websites for more information:</p>
