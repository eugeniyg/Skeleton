    <h1>KYC Policy of Geminilab N.V.</h1>
    <i>Last updated: 19.07.2022</i>
    <br/>

    <p>When a user makes an aggregate lifetime total of deposits exceeding EUR 2000 or requests a withdrawal of any
      amount inside the <a href="https://slotsbet.io/">slotsbet.io</a>. Platform, then it is compulsory for them to
      perform a full KYC process.</p>
    <p>During this process, the user will have to input some basic details about themselves and then upload</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A copy of Government Issued Photo ID (in some cases front and back depending on the doc)</li>
      <li>A selfie of themselves holding the ID doc</li>
      <li>A bank statement/Utility Bill</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once uploaded, the user will get a “Temporarily Approved” Status and the documents will now be on our side,
      and the “KYC Team” will have 24hrs to go over them and email the user about the outcome:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Approval</li>
      <li>Rejection</li>
      <li>More information needed – No change in Status</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the user is on “Temporarily Approved” Status then</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can use the platform normally</li>
      <li>They cannot deposit more than EUR 500 in aggregate total</li>
      <li>They cannot complete any withdrawal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Guideline for the “KYC Process”</h2>

      <li>ID document is the same as in “1”. Make sure photo/ID number is the same</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes on the “KYC Process”</h2>
    <p>1) When the KYC process is unsuccessful then the reason is documented and a support ticket is created in the
      system. The ticket number along with an explanation is communicated back to the user.</p>
    <p>2) Once all proper documents are in our possession then the account gets approved.</p>

    <h2>“Other AML measures”</h2>
    <p>1) If a user has not passed full KYC then they cannot make additional deposits or withdrawals of any amount.</p>
    <p>2) If a user has passed the KYC process successfully then</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a deposit limit per transaction (max EUR 2,000)</li>
      <li>Prior to any withdrawal there is a detailed algorithmic and manual check on the activity and balance of the
        user to see if the amount withdrawn is a result of proper activity in the platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3) Under no circumstances may a user transfer funds directly to another user.</p>
