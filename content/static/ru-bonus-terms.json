Although our bonuses are available to all of our Players, restrictions in a Player’s country of residence may mean that bonuses are unavailable to them. No bonuses are available to Players from Sweden.\n14. Bonus abuse by Players is not permitted. The following bonus rates (i.e. the ratio of deposits made using bonus funds to those placed using normal funds) shall be deemed as abuse: 70% if a player has made between 5 and 9 deposits and 50% if a player has made 10 or more deposits. In the event of such abuse, the Company reserves the right to prohibit Players from receiving any bonuses and cancel any winnings obtained using bonus funds both during and after wagering. If a player has a bonus rate of 85% if they’ve placed between 5 and 9 deposits or 70% if they’ve placed 10 or more deposits, they won’t be able to receive and/or activate bonuses and/or free spins which are offered as part of the relevant promotion or offers.\n15. Players are strictly forbidden from employing any strategies when using active bonuses to fulfill wagering requirements. If a Player is found to have employed such strategies, or the Company has reasonable grounds to believe that a Player has been using a bonus solely for financial gain, the Company reserves the right to revoke the winnings of such Players. Such strategies include, but are not limited to, these:\n\n* delaying game rounds in any game, including free spins and bonus features, to a later time when you have no wagering requirements;\n* leaving large bets on the table, for example in blackjack, and returning to the game after bonus wagering has been completed;\n* playing games with bonus money to build up in-game value, lose the bonus funds, and then cash out on the built-up value during real-money play;\n* using strategies that take advantage of any software bug or failure.\n\n16. When a deposit bonus is attached, all funds are locked under the wagering requirement. For the cash balance to be unlocked and become cashable, the wagering requirement needs to be met.\n17. While playing with a deposit bonus attached, the deposit funds are used first, then the bonus funds. All winnings derived from play with an attached bonus are considered bonus funds and fall under the bonus’ wagering requirement. The use of bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages is prohibited. For example when bonus or cash funds are used purely to progress through the bonus stages (e.g. collecting 9 out of 10 coins to reach that bonus feature) and then final stages (e.g. playing to collect the final coin to reach 10 out of 10 coins to reach the bonus feature) completed with cash bets when bonus funds have been forfeited, lost or wagering met and converted to cash. All the winnings gained during that play may be considered void.\n18. Only one bonus can be activated at any one time. Deposit bonuses cannot be combined.\n19. It is strictly prohibited to delay any game round in any game, including free spins features and bonus features to a later time when you have no more wagering requirement.
