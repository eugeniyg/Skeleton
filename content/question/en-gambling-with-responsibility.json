      "answer": "Yes. If you want to close your account for a while (6-12 months), choose self-exclusion. Also, you can set a cooling-off period. You won’t be able to make deposits and play during the specified period (from 1 day to 6 months), also you will be excluded from all advertising offers. Go to the “Responsible Gambling” tab on your Profile."
